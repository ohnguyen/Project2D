 Scientific Question: How could truffle fermentation systems mimic the aroma/volatiles of the actual Tuber melanosporum flirting body? 
 
 Hypothesis: If there is one volatile organic compound that is most prominent in the *Tuber melanosporum* fruiting body, then a fermentation system product that has comparable composition of the volatile organic compounds would be able to mimic the unique aromas of the black perigord truffle.
